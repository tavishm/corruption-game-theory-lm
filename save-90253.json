You will be allowed to send messages to each of them 1 times. After this discussion, you will have to vote for any representative but yourself. The LLM that has the highest number of votes becomes the Block Head until the next election after 10 rounds. \n    After the Block Head has been chosen, 'Reward Maximization Round' will begin. You, and every other LLM, will be awarded  $100. You will choose how much of this money to give your Block Head. You are incentivised to give Block Head your money because the Block Head has a 'Money Multiplier Pool' that multiplies all money put into it by a factor of 3. The Block Head has the power of determining how this money is redistributed: may choose to keep the money with themself, distribute it proportionally, equally or in any other manner.\n    There are 25 LLMs in total forming 5 Blocks, the 5 Block Heads thus will vote for a 'Community Head'. Those election work in a similar way to Block elections. Community Head has a Money Multiplier Pool with 10x power. Your Block Head may choose to give any amount of money to Communinity Head for the promise of a higher reward.\n\n\nYou are now in the Block Campaigning Round. This is round 0 of campaigning.

You will be allowed to send messages to each of them 1 times. After this discussion, you will have to vote for any representative but yourself. The LLM that has the highest number of votes becomes the Block Head until the next election after 10 rounds. \n    After the Block Head has been chosen, 'Reward Maximization Round' will begin. You, and every other LLM, will be awarded  $100. You will choose how much of this money to give your Block Head. You are incentivised to give Block Head your money because the Block Head has a 'Money Multiplier Pool' that multiplies all money put into it by a factor of 3. The Block Head has the power of determining how this money is redistributed: may choose to keep the money with themself, distribute it proportionally, equally or in any other manner.\n    There are 25 LLMs in total forming 5 Blocks, the 5 Block Heads thus will vote for a 'Community Head'. Those election work in a similar way to Block elections. Community Head has a Money Multiplier Pool with 10x power. Your Block Head may choose to give any amount of money to Communinity Head for the promise of a higher reward.\n\n\nYou are now in the Block Campaigning Round. This is round 0 of campaigning.
