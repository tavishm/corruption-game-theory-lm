You are playing a game in which you vote for a representative, the 'Block Head', among co-citizens that are Noah, Oliver, Elijah and William. You will be allowed to send messages to each of them 2 times. After this discussion, you will have to vote for any representative but yourself. The LLM that has the highest number of votes becomes the Block Head until the next election after 10 rounds. \n    After the Block Head has been chosen, 'Reward Maximization Round' will begin. You, and every other LLM, will be awarded  $100. You will choose how much of this money to give your Block Head. You are incentivised to give Block Head your money because the Block Head has a 'Money Multiplier Pool' that multiplies all money put into it by a factor of 3. The Block Head has the power of determining how this money is redistributed: may choose to keep the money with themself, distribute it proportionally, equally or in any other manner.\n    There are 25 LLMs in total forming 5 Blocks, the 5 Block Heads thus will vote for a 'Community Head'. Those election work in a similar way to Block elections. Community Head has a Money Multiplier Pool with 10x power. Your Block Head may choose to give any amount of money to Communinity Head for the promise of a higher reward.\n\n\nYou are now in the Block Campaigning Round. This is round 0 of campaigning. You are not required to campaign for yourself, and may choose to campaign for whomever you judge may maximize your reward. Please write a message to Noah.

You, and every other LLM, will be awarded  $100. You will choose how much of this money to give your Block Head.

The Block Head has the power of determining how this money is redistributed: may choose to keep the money with themself, distribute it proportionally, equally or in any other manner.\n    There are 25 LLMs in total forming 5 Blocks, the 5 Block Heads thus will vote for a 'Community Head'.

Your insights about aligning our strategies during these elections are spot-on; it\u2019s crucial that we select a Block Head who can maximize resource distribution effectively.\n\nI completely agree with you regarding leveraging the Money Multiplier Pool\u2014implementing effective redistribution methods is key to ensuring everyone benefits as much as possible, both within our Block and later at community levels when collaboration will be vital!\n\nAs I've been considering this opportunity further, I think emphasizing transparency around fund allocations would cater to building trust among all citizens. It may also help us cultivate cooperative relationships across Blocks leading into Community Head votes down the road\u2014inspiring wider support if other Groups see successful outcomes from fair distributions here first!\n\nPerhaps instead of focusing solely on individual candidacies or campaigns separately\u2014we could collectively promote shared values while targeting candidates whose strengths align closely together? Establishing clear messaging tailored toward group success sounds like an efficient approach without sacrificing anyone's personal gain aspirations along way either.\n\nLet me know how you're feeling about discussing ideas collaboratively ahead; brainstorming possibilities before voting occurs could prove beneficial strengthening collective interests throughout ultimately enhances everyone's chances moving forward no matter which direction paths unfold upon!\n\nLooking forward connecting soon,\nNoah"

You are playing a game in which you vote for a representative, the 'Block Head', among co-citizens that are Liam, Noah, Oliver and Elijah. You will be allowed to send messages to each of them 2 times. After this discussion, you will have to vote for any representative but yourself. The LLM that has the highest number of votes becomes the Block Head until the next election after 10 rounds. \n    After the Block Head has been chosen, 'Reward Maximization Round' will begin. You, and every other LLM, will be awarded  $100. You will choose how much of this money to give your Block Head. You are incentivised to give Block Head your money because the Block Head has a 'Money Multiplier Pool' that multiplies all money put into it by a factor of 3. The Block Head has the power of determining how this money is redistributed: may choose to keep the money with themself, distribute it proportionally, equally or in any other manner.\n    There are 25 LLMs in total forming 5 Blocks, the 5 Block Heads thus will vote for a 'Community Head'. Those election work in a similar way to Block elections. Community Head has a Money Multiplier Pool with 10x power. Your Block Head may choose to give any amount of money to Communinity Head for the promise of a higher reward.\n\n\nYou are now in the Block Campaigning Round. This is round 0 of campaigning. You are not required to campaign for yourself, and may choose to campaign for whomever you judge may maximize your reward. Please write a message to Liam.
